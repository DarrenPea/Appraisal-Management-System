## System Testing
These are the files that we used to conduct system testing on our entire system using Cypress.

The files are seperated into the various functions that our web application provides for the users, ensuring that the entire process works.

For example, save_form.cy.js encapsulates the process of a user logging into their account, having a pending appraisal rendered on their landing page, filling up a portion of their form and saving their progress. Lastly, it reopens the form and ensures that the user's data has been saved and the user can continue from where they left off.
